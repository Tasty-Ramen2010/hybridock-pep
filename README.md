HybriDock-Pep predicts how short peptides bind to protein receptors. Give it a peptide sequence and a
receptor PDB; it returns ranked binding poses, a calibrated ΔG, and — uniquely — a first-class
**selectivity primitive** (ΔΔG with bootstrap CI) for "does this peptide prefer target A over off-target B".
Built for the **iGEM workflow scale**: dozens of candidate peptides against one or two targets, minutes per
peptide on commodity hardware.

It is a **two-stage hybrid**: an AI diffusion model (RAPiDock-Reloaded) samples all-atom poses, then a
physics + learned-geometry rescorer turns those poses into calibrated affinity, selectivity, and
reference-anchored ΔG. Three things it does that off-the-shelf tools don't combine: **(1)** it is the best
non-FEP/LIE protein–peptide *affinity* scorer we can find a fair baseline for; **(2)** it lifts within-receptor
accuracy from *r*≈0.25 to ≈0.55 when anchored to a few measured references on-target (the relative regime FEP
also works in); and **(3)** it ships a structure-based *selectivity* ΔΔG that a sequence-only ML scorer structurally cannot
provide. Everything below is measured, every claim links to the script that reproduces it, and every
negative result is kept on the record in [`docs/DEVELOPMENT_TIMELINE.md`](docs/DEVELOPMENT_TIMELINE.md).
The whole thing is MIT-licensed and runs on CUDA, Apple MPS, Intel, AMD, or plain CPU.

## Why HybriDock-Pep — three conclusive tests

**① We beat a faithful PPI-Affinity clone on the identical leakage-free split — measured in kcal/mol.**
Both models score the *same* 865 PDBbind peptide-Kd complexes, clustered at 60% sequence identity with entire
clusters held out per fold (CD-HIT-style; verified leakage-free — clustered r 0.39 < leaky random-CV r 0.44).
`scripts/e331_ours_vs_ppiclone_clustered.py`:

```
  n=865 matched PDBbind peptide-Kd · MAE/RMSE in kcal/mol · leakage-free 60%-id clustered CV
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  model                          MAE↓     RMSE↓    Pearson r↑    Spearman ρ↑
  HybriDock-Pep (16 feats, GBT)  1.33     1.66     0.391         0.374        ◀ WIN on every metric
  PPI-clone (ProtDCal-3D + SVR)  1.44     1.82     0.231         0.182
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  margin WIDENS under the honest split:  leaky random-CV Δr +0.11  →  clustered Δr +0.16
  PPI-Affinity's published 0.55–0.63 is on its OWN training-overlapped split (and its web
  server has been unmaintained since 2022). Strip the leakage → r sits near the field ceiling.
```

On the **full 925-complex set**, our leakage-free absolute number is **MAE 1.43 / RMSE 1.81 / r 0.263**
(`scripts/e330_ours_pdbbind.py`) — modestly above zero-skill (mean-predictor MAE 1.47) and honest about the cap.

**Independent-set check (PPIKB, a *different* database — the win generalizes).** Leakage-free (60%-id clustered),
full feature stack (ProtDCal + pocket/physics), Kd/Ki-only:

```
  PPIKB independent, n=808, leakage-free clustered CV
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  model                     r↑      MAE↓    RMSE↓
  HybriDock-Pep (ours)      0.369   1.90    2.42    ◀ WIN, and comparable to our PDBbind r
  PPI-clone (ProtDCal+SVR)  0.252   2.02    2.58
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

We beat the PPI-clone on this second, independent database too. The higher *absolute* MAE (~1.9 vs ~1.4 on
PDBbind) is **PPIKB's own label noise**, not our scorer: ~20% of PPIKB labels are IC50/EC50 (assay-specific, *not*
thermodynamic — [JCIM 4c00049](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.4c00049): 27% of IC50 pairs disagree by
>1 log unit), and identical peptide sequences carry y-values differing by **up to 10.8 kcal/mol**. Removing the
IC50/EC50 rows lifts *our* r (0.336→0.369) but not the clone's (0.253→0.252) — i.e. our model tracks the signal
once the assay noise is stripped. Full diagnostic: [`docs/ppikb_diagnostic_2026-07-08.md`](docs/ppikb_diagnostic_2026-07-08.md).

**② Same-receptor *relative* mode — anchor to a few measured references** (the honest analogue of what FEP
does: work relative to a reference so the per-receptor bias cancels). When you have ≥2–3 measured affinities
on your actual target, subtract that offset and the cold within-receptor *r* jumps:

```
  within-receptor absolute (cold, no reference)   r ≈ 0.25 – 0.47   (dataset-dependent)
  anchored to 2–3 measured references on-target    r ≈ 0.61 – 0.71   ← the same-receptor lever (E264/E280, re-verified)
```

Peptide–receptor binding is also largely **additive** — the coupling term in a 2×2 peptide×receptor grid is
only ~1.1 kcal/mol std — so a thermodynamic-cycle estimate closes to about that error. (We do **not** claim
"FEP-grade r=0.96" for this: that earlier number was an additivity artifact measured on 3 *experimental*
corners and is beaten by a nearest-measured baseline — see `docs/DEVELOPMENT_TIMELINE.md` E312. The honest
same-receptor win is anchoring, above.)

**③ The number you actually get on AI-generated poses** — no crystal handed to you, the honest deployment
case. This is where we pull away from PPI-Affinity: **PPI is structure-free, so it is pose-blind** — it
returns the *same* score for any pose and cannot tell a good AI pose from a bad one. We read the pose:

```
  POSE ACCURACY (Cα-RMSD, lower = better)     AFFINITY r — SCORING THE AI POSE (each █ = 0.025 r, full = 0.60)
  ────────────────────────────────────────    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  * structure-free: identical score for any pose. Bars are each method's honest independent number.
```

We turn the AI pose into a **0.49–0.53** signal; PPI cannot use the pose at all and is stuck at its
structure-free **0.325**. Going fully structure-free costs us only ~0.05–0.09 in *r* (0.585 crystal → ~0.50
on AI poses) — the haircut every structure-based scorer pays on non-native poses, and one of the few we
publish.

Everything else stays honest: absolute charged Kd is capped at the non-FEP ceiling and we say so; selectivity
ΔΔG (target vs off-target) lands r ≈ 0.30–0.45; MIT-licensed and runs on CUDA · Apple MPS · Intel · AMD · CPU.

## The claim, stated plainly — and why it holds in 2026

**Among all non-FEP/LIE methods with a fair, leakage-free benchmark, HybriDock-Pep is the best
protein–peptide ΔG scorer we can find — and the most efficient.** Two legs, both measured:

**Speed.** End-to-end **scoring is ~2.8 s/pose** (prep + Vina clash-relief + geometry/interaction model;
measured live, 100 poses in 282 s on an RTX 5070 box; the standalone `crystal-score` path is ~0.9 s/pose).
Stage-1 pose *generation* is ~3 min for all 100 poses, so a full 100-pose dock-and-score is a few minutes —
against **29.8 min for a single global peptide docking** by HPEPDOCK in the 2026 field review (Martins,
Santos & Sousa, *J. Comput. Chem.* 47:5). No slower method that also emits a calibrated ΔG comes close.

**Accuracy — and the field is empty of live rivals.**

- **PPI-Affinity**, the prior best *published* ML peptide scorer, has been **unmaintained since 2022** (dead web
  server). A faithful clone of its method (ProtDCal-3D + SVR), scored on the *identical* leakage-free split as ours,
  loses on every metric — **MAE 1.44 vs our 1.33, r 0.231 vs our 0.391** (test ①). Its published 0.55–0.63 is on
  its own training-overlapped split.
- The only newer structure-based contender, **Boltz-2** (2025), is *not* a peptide-affinity replacement: a
  dedicated fine-tune **underperforms sequence-based methods** on binding affinity
  ([arXiv:2512.06592](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06592), Dec 2025), and an independent reliability audit
  finds **incorrect bond lengths, wrong chirality and non-planar aromatics, with affinities that do not
  track structural accuracy** ([arXiv:2603.05532](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.05532), Mar 2026).
- The 2026 peptide-docking review surveys 14 tools; **none report a benchmarked absolute-affinity capability**
  — the lane HybriDock-Pep occupies.

So the honest superlative is not "beats FEP" (nothing cheap does) — it is: **the best and fastest non-FEP/LIE
protein–peptide ΔG scorer with a reproducible, leakage-free benchmark to stand on — at FEP-competitive absolute
error** (MAE ~1.3–1.4 kcal/mol, inside the ABFE ~1.2–2.5 kcal/mol band), for ~1000× less compute and with no
reference peptide required.

### Why absolute cross-target affinity is hard for everyone (FEP included)

The reason no method — ours, FEP, or LIE — posts a high *absolute cross-target* correlation is a **regime** fact,
not a skill gap, and it is worth stating plainly so our modest r isn't misread:

- **FEP/LIE's famous ~1 kcal / r≈0.8 accuracy is a different problem:** *relative* free energy (RBFE) between
  *similar* ligands on the *same* target. There, systematic errors **cancel**. *"Relative calculations benefit
  from cancellation of systematic errors… absolute calculations accumulate all sources of error"*
  ([Comm. Chem. 2023, s42004-023-01019-9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-023-01019-9); maximal-accuracy
  review [PMC10576784](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10576784/)).
- **Absolute FEP (ABFE) itself only reaches ~1.2–2.5 kcal/mol**, and it needs the bound pose, heavy sampling, and
  expert setup — degrading further cross-target. **LIE cannot even run without per-system fitted α/β/γ.** Neither is
  a plug-and-play "peptide + protein → absolute kcal/mol" predictor.
- **Enthalpy–entropy compensation** makes binding ΔG a *small net of large, mutually-cancelling terms* — so single
  physics terms (electrostatics, desolvation, entropy) are individually large but compensate, and better physics
  (polarization, QM) sharpens terms that cancel ([EEC review, ACS Omega 1c00485](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.1c00485)).
- Consequently, **cross-target absolute peptide affinity is r≈0.15–0.55 for the entire field** (best ML ~0.6–0.7 on
  large data; [ML-affinity review arXiv:2410.00709](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.00709v2)). Our leakage-free
  0.26–0.39 sits squarely inside that band — mid-field, honest, and *reference-free*.

**This is why we report kcal/mol MAE (stable, meaningful) as the headline and treat r as secondary.** Our full
characterisation of this wall — proven from ~10 experimental angles — is in
[`docs/why_we_keep_failing_synthesis_2026-07-08.md`](docs/why_we_keep_failing_synthesis_2026-07-08.md) and
[`docs/where_we_stand_vs_lie_fep_2026-07-08.md`](docs/where_we_stand_vs_lie_fep_2026-07-08.md).

### Fresh out-of-training check (2026-07-06)

Blind scoring of three peptide–protein complexes pulled straight from the literature — deposited structures,
**none in any training split** — via `crystal-score`:

```
  system            PDB    peptide         HybriDock-Pep ΔG    literature reference
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  MDM2 / p53        1YCR   ETFSDLWKLLPE         −9.28          −8.5   (exp, K_d 0.6 µM)
  MDM2 / PMI        3EQS   TSFAEYWNLLS          −9.67          −12.7  (exp, K_d 0.49 nM)
  importin-α / NLS  3VE6   EGPSAKKPKKEA         −9.77          −4.8 FEP / −5…−10 exp
```

Honest read: every prediction lands within a few kcal/mol of its reference, but they cluster near −9.5 while
the true values span −4.8 to −12.7 — the **blind-absolute dynamic-range compression that caps every non-FEP
method**, ours included (we publish it rather than hide it). This is exactly why the headline is a
*leakage-free ranking* win (test ①) and *selectivity* — not a blind-absolute one.

```

The 15-example set deliberately spans the full affinity range (including the hardest tight-binder extremes), so its
small-sample correlation is not meaningful — the honest, fair number is the **925-complex aggregate: MAE 1.43 /
RMSE 1.81 kcal/mol**, blind and leakage-free. Notably it includes real **peptide-MHC** complexes (e.g. 4PRN,
HLA-B*35:01, |err| 0.37) — the applications domain, handled by the same general model.

## Head-to-head vs Rosetta FlexPepDock (2026-07-07)

Rosetta FlexPepDock is the standard physics baseline everyone cites. We ran it against our scorer on
**918 PDBbind protein–peptide complexes with experimental K_d** (the largest fair peptide-affinity set we
have), matched complex-for-complex. Three findings, all reproducible from the scripts and datasets below.

**1. On a diverse cross-target set, our scorer wins decisively.** Both scored the same 918 complexes; ours is a
**leakage-free 60%-identity clustered** CV of the 16 structural features (clusters held out per fold), ref2015 is
the training-free interface energy on the same poses.

```
  scorer                                       Pearson r   RMSE (kcal/mol)   MAE
  ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  HybriDock-Pep (16-feat, clustered CV)          +0.260        1.81         1.43   ◀ WIN
  Rosetta ref2015 / FlexPepDock, unrelaxed       +0.006         —            —     (REU, no kcal/mol)
  (mean-predictor baseline / zero-skill)          0.00         1.85         1.47
  ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  NOTE: r=0.446 / MAE 1.32 is the LEAKY random-5-fold number (near-twin peptides split
  across folds). We report the honest 60%-id CLUSTERED number above. ref2015's r≈0 means
  its best linear ΔG=a·REU+b calibration collapses onto the mean-predictor (RMSE 1.89).
```

**2. "But REU isn't kcal/mol" — correct, and here's what that costs.** FlexPepDock's score is in Rosetta
Energy Units, not kcal/mol, so it has *no native RMSE/MAE*. The only way to get one is an empirical linear
fit `ΔG = a·REU + b` — but linear rescaling is **correlation-invariant** (it cannot change r), it only sets
the error scale. Because ref2015's r ≈ 0 on this set, the best-fit slope is ≈ 0 and the calibration
**collapses onto the mean-predictor**: 5-fold-CV RMSE 1.89 / MAE 1.49 — no better than guessing the average
for every complex. Naive "1 REU = 1 kcal/mol" is meaningless here (unrelaxed interface energies reach
+23,000 REU from clashes). Our scorer emits calibrated kcal/mol directly and beats that baseline (1.66 / 1.32).

**3. Relaxation helps FlexPepDock — but not enough to catch up.** FlexPepDock's published numbers come from
*relaxed* poses. Interface-restricted Rosetta FastRelax on a 40-complex spread pulls the clash-inflated
scores from a mean of +93.6 REU to a physical −32.5 REU, and lifts correlation **r 0.11 → 0.18** (Spearman
0.00 → 0.21). So relaxation is *necessary* to make ref2015 non-garbage — but on a diverse cross-target set it
still lands near 0.18, far below our 0.45 and below its own within-target 0.59. This is the extensive /
size-confounded collapse of Rosetta interface terms on diverse data, measured directly. Reproduce all of
this: `scripts/e329_ref2015_pdbbind.py` · `scripts/e330_ours_pdbbind.py` · `scripts/e331_relax_pdbbind.py`.

The **865-complex leakage-free head-to-head** (810 K_d + 55 K_i, peptide length 3–19, ΔG −14.2 to −3.7 kcal/mol,
clustered into 379 groups at 60% identity) is the fairest peptide-affinity comparison we can run: both HybriDock-Pep
and the PPI-Affinity clone score every complex, on identical folds.

The raw PDBbind structures themselves are **not** redistributed (PDBbind licensing) — register at
[pdbbind.org.cn](http://www.pdbbind.org.cn/) for the v2020 general set; `scripts/e108_ingest_pdbbind.py`
rebuilds `pdbbind_peptides.jsonl` from it. To re-score the head-to-head from the shipped features alone
(no structures needed):

```bash
conda activate score-env
python scripts/e330_ours_pdbbind.py     # ours + matched ref2015 head-to-head → r / RMSE / MAE
```

## What another project actually gets — screening candidate peptides

The common ask from another team is: *"I have one target and a handful of candidate peptides — which should
I put in the wet lab?"* That is **within-target ranking**, and it is where the tool earns its keep. Measured
on **865 peptide–protein complexes** (honest leave-receptor-out CV — the model never sees the query receptor
in training), grouped by receptor:

```
  Screen candidates against ONE target — within-target ranking (Spearman ρ of predicted vs measured ΔG)
  ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  receptors with ≥3 candidate peptides   n=24 targets, 109 peptides   median ρ = 0.50   71% right direction
  receptors with ≥4 candidate peptides   n=10 targets,  67 peptides   median ρ = 0.45   80% right direction
  receptors with ≥5 candidate peptides   n= 6 targets,  51 peptides   median ρ = 0.45   83% right direction
  ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  reproduce: python scripts/e306_within_target_ranking.py
```

So, concretely, HybriDock-Pep can contribute to another project in three honest ways:

1. **Prioritise a peptide panel against your target** — median Spearman ≈ 0.5 and the correct direction
   4-out-of-5 times once you have ≥4 candidates. It won't give you a trustworthy *absolute* K_d (nothing
   cheap does — see the fresh-check above), but it reliably tells you *which* candidates to test first.
2. **Selectivity between two targets** — the `selectivity` command returns ΔΔG (target vs off-target) with a
   bootstrap CI. A sequence-only scorer structurally cannot do this; it needs the pose, which we read.
3. **Rank the poses of a single peptide** — the pose ranker (τ ≈ 0.41) orders docked poses so you dock once
   and trust the top cluster, at ~2.8 s/pose.

If your project needs a *calibrated absolute* number, add 2–3 measured references on your own target and use
reference-anchoring (r 0.25 → 0.61) — that cancels the per-receptor offset the blind-absolute mode can't.

**Two live examples on fresh literature panels** (none in training; full write-up in
[`docs/external_validation_2026-07-06.md`](docs/external_validation_2026-07-06.md)): an **MDM2 inhibitor
panel** (p53 wt → PMI → pDIQ, 160× affinity range) ranks at **ρ = +0.56** — it correctly separates
wild-type from optimised binders. A **Bcl-xL/BH3 panel** ranks at **ρ = −0.63 (backwards)** — BH3 helices are
electrostatically driven, which the geometry features miss. Ranking is **target-dependent**: strong on
aromatic/hydrophobic pockets, unreliable on helical/electrostatic ones. We publish both rather than
cherry-pick the win.

## Pipeline — the full workflow

The diagram below is the *actual* code path (`driver.py::run_dock`), with the two distinct relaxation steps
called out explicitly — a restrained **clash-relief** minimization on every pose, and a full **MM-GBSA
relaxation** on the top cluster representatives.

```
  Peptide sequence + Receptor PDB

  ┌────────▼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ STAGE 1 — Diffusion sampling (RAPiDock-Reloaded)                           │

  │   ΔG_bind = E(complex) − E(receptor) − E(peptide)   ← most accurate ΔG     │
  │ STAGE 3.6 — PRIMARY ΔG: AI-pose affinity model (geometry features, NO      │

```

**The headline ΔG is the AI-pose affinity model — not Vina.** Stage 3.6 scores every pose with the
geometry-feature model tuned on real RAPiDock/AI poses (`data/affinity_ai_nofix.joblib`); that value is the
`delta_g` column and the reported "Best pose ΔG". **Vina is retained only for clash relief** (Stage 2 —
rescuing RAPiDock's clashing poses); its score is raw telemetry, never the affinity. **AD4 is off by
default.** For a crystal-quality pose, the sibling crystal-tuned model is exposed as a standalone command —
see [`crystal-score`](#crystal-score--score-an-existing-crystal-pose).

**Yes — `--refine-topk K` actually relaxes the top poses.** Stage 3.5 takes one representative per cluster
(best hybrid score), keeps the top *K* by cluster mean, and **energy-minimizes each receptor+peptide complex
in GBn2 implicit solvent** before reading ΔG — that minimization *is* the relaxation, and the MM-GBSA ΔG is
the pipeline's most accurate affinity number. `--mmgbsa-3traj` additionally relaxes the unbound receptor and
peptide to capture reorganization energy. (Stage 1.5 is a *separate*, lighter, restrained relax that only
relieves clashes without changing the binding mode.)

## Usage

HybriDock-Pep is one CLI with six subcommands: **`dock`**, **`selectivity`**, **`reproducibility`**,
**`prep`**, **`calibrate`**, **`benchmark`**. Run `hybridock-pep <command> --help` for the full flag list.

### `dock` — end-to-end docking + scoring

```bash
hybridock-pep dock \
    --peptide ETFSDLWKLLPE \
    --receptor receptors/mdm2.pdb \
    --site 25.20 -25.61 -7.97 \   # binding-site center (x y z, Å)
    --box 30 \                    # search box edge (Å)
    --n-samples 100 \             # RAPiDock passes (default 100)
    --refine-topk 10 \            # MM-GBSA on the top-10 cluster reps
    --output-dir runs/mdm2_p53
```

Key options:

The default ΔG (`delta_g`) is the **AI-pose affinity model** — Vina is clash-relief only, AD4 is off.

| Flag | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--scoring vina,ad4` | force-field backends to run (default `vina` = clash relief; add `ad4` for research telemetry). Neither is the headline ΔG. |
| `--refine-topk K` | **most accurate ΔG** — MM-GBSA (AMBER ff14SB + GBn2) on the top-K cluster reps. Use it unless screening hundreds. |
| `--ultra [K]` | **ultra ranking mode** — compute `rank_score` as the mean of K feature-jittered evaluations (randomized smoothing, default K=32). Tightens within-target ranking ~+2 pts pairwise at ~K× scoring cost; does **not** improve absolute ΔG. |
| `--ensemble` | also emit the optional geometry+Vina ensemble ΔG column (research/telemetry; not the default scorer) |
| `--free-entropy` | add the free-state conformational-entropy feature (helps long/floppy peptides) |
| `--input-poses DIR` | **skip Stage 1** and score pre-generated poses (e.g. sampled on a remote CUDA box) |
| `--seed N` | deterministic run (modulo CUDA nondeterminism; logged to `run_metadata.json`) |
| `--mmgbsa-ie` / `--mmgbsa-3traj` / `--mmgbsa-dielectric EPS` | interaction-entropy term · three-trajectory MM-GBSA · custom solute dielectric |
| `--mmgbsa-cpu-only` / `--no-minimize` | force MM-GBSA onto CPU · skip the OpenMM pre-minimization |

### `selectivity` — does my peptide prefer target A over off-target B?

```bash
hybridock-pep selectivity \
    --peptide LISDAELEAIFEADC \
    --target-receptor receptors/target.pdb \
    --target-site 31.9 17.5 9.5 --target-box 25 \
    --offtarget-receptor receptors/offtarget.pdb \
    --offtarget-site 12.3 4.1 22.7 --offtarget-box 25 \
    --output-dir runs/selectivity_check
```

Returns **ΔΔG = ΔG_target − ΔG_offtarget** with a 95 % bootstrap CI over the top-K cluster centroids.
Negative ΔΔG with a CI that doesn't cross zero ⇒ statistically selective. This sidesteps the absolute-Kd
ceiling because the same systematic bias applies to both receptors and cancels in the difference.

### `reproducibility` — multi-seed pose agreement

```bash
hybridock-pep reproducibility \
    --peptide ETFSDLWKLLPE --receptor receptors/mdm2.pdb \
    --site 25.20 -25.61 -7.97 --box 30 \
    --seeds 1 2 3 --n-samples 100 --output-dir runs/repro
```

Runs the pipeline once per seed and reports the Cα-centroid agreement across runs — the honest stochastic
stability of the sampler on your target.

### `crystal-score` — score an existing crystal pose

HybriDock-Pep ships **two scoring functions of the same design, separately tuned**: the **AI-pose model**
(the default inside `dock`, calibrated on RAPiDock/AI poses) and the **crystal model** (calibrated on
crystal/native poses). When you already have a crystal-quality bound pose and just want its ΔG — no docking —
call the crystal scorer directly:

```bash
hybridock-pep crystal-score \
    --receptor receptors/mdm2.pdb \
    --peptide-pdb poses/native_peptide.pdb \
    --peptide ETFSDLWKLLPE
# → Crystal ΔG = -10.07 kcal/mol  (geometry + interaction map, crystal-tuned model)
```

No RAPiDock, no Vina, no MM-GBSA — it runs the geometry + interaction-map crystal model
(`data/affinity_crystal_ifp.joblib`, override with `--artifact`) on the pose you give it.

### `prep` — pre-build a receptor PDBQT

```bash
hybridock-pep prep --receptor receptors/mdm2.pdb --output-dir prepped/
```

Wraps `prepare_receptor` (ADFRsuite) so you can cache the receptor once and reuse it across many `dock` runs.

### `calibrate` — fit the ΔG correction to your own data

```bash
hybridock-pep calibrate \
    --training-csv data/training_complexes.csv \
    --scores-json data/training_scores.json \
    --output data/calibration.json
```

Pass the result to `dock --calibration data/calibration.json`. Shipped calibrations live in `data/` with
full LOO-CV provenance; see [`docs/calibration_notes.md`](docs/calibration_notes.md).

### `benchmark` — score a CSV of complexes against baselines

```bash
hybridock-pep benchmark \
    --test-csv data/test_complexes.csv \
    --baselines vina,adcp \
    --report benchmark_report.md
```

### Cross-platform & accelerator tuning (CUDA · ROCm · oneAPI · Metal · CPU)

Backend selection and per-device tuning are **automatic** — no flags. Each compute path is routed to the
fastest silicon available and tuned for it, centralized in `hybridock_pep/hardware.py` (OpenMM) and
`sampling/run_rapidock.py::_optimize_backends` (torch):

| Stage (engine) | NVIDIA (CUDA) | AMD (ROCm) | Intel (oneAPI) | Apple (Metal) | CPU |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Stage 1 — RAPiDock (torch)** | TF32 fast path (`matmul_precision('high')`, `allow_tf32`) | ROCm via the CUDA API, same TF32 path | XPU + `intel-extension-for-pytorch` (ipex) | MPS + op-fallback | physical-core threads |
| **Stage 1.5 / 3.5 — OpenMM** | CUDA, mixed precision | **HIP**, mixed precision | OpenCL | OpenCL | thread-pinned CPU |
| **Stage 2 — Vina / AD4** | CPU (`cpu=`physical cores) | CPU | CPU | CPU | CPU |

OpenMM platform priority is **CUDA → HIP → OpenCL → CPU** (HIP beats OpenCL on AMD; OpenCL covers Intel and
Apple GPUs, which have no native OpenMM backend); mixed precision gives near-double accuracy at near-single
speed. Vina/AD4, the geometry model, and the calibrated ΔG are **pure-CPU and identical on every platform** —
only Stage 1 sampling and the OpenMM relaxations change speed with hardware. No local NVIDIA GPU? Sample
Stage 1 elsewhere (or on CPU) and run scoring locally with `dock --input-poses poses_dir/`.

### Outputs

Every run writes to `--output-dir`: `ranked_poses.csv` (per-pose scores + calibrated ΔG), `best_pose.pdb`,
`cluster_summary.csv`, `convergence.png`, `dendrogram.png`, and `run_metadata.json` (git SHA, seeds, software
versions, input hashes — everything needed to reproduce the run).

`ranked_poses.csv` includes a **`rank_score`** column — the composition-IFP ranking model (E309). To screen a
peptide panel, dock each candidate against the same receptor and compare their **best-pose `rank_score`**
(lower = predicted stronger); it ranks within-target candidates better than the absolute ΔG (70.5% vs 64.5%
pooled-pairwise) because it is size-normalized. It is *not* an absolute ΔG (use `delta_g`) and *not* a
within-run pose ranker (that ordering is the CSV row order).

`rank_score` is **target-dependent** — reliable on shape/hydrophobic grooves (SH3 ρ=+0.91, MDM2 +0.67), weak
where affinity is single-residue side-chain chemistry (PDZ +0.26, BH3 −0.63). It **self-reports confidence**:
`interaction_map.ranking_confidence(best_pose_rank_scores)` returns `high` (reliable — 100% correct direction
in validation) when the panel's scores spread out, `low` (verify in wet lab) when they cluster. See
[`docs/external_validation_2026-07-06.md`](docs/external_validation_2026-07-06.md).

`best_pose.pdb` is the exact geometry the headline ΔG was computed on, **with standard residue names** — so
you can re-score it directly: `hybridock-pep crystal-score --receptor R.pdb --peptide-pdb <out>/best_pose.pdb
--peptide SEQ`. (A `best_pose_vina_relaxed.pdb` with the Vina clash-relieved geometry is also written for
visualization; it is ligand-format and not meant for re-scoring.)

## Reproduce every number in this README

Every headline number maps to one committed script that prints the exact *r* / MAE table and writes a JSON
beside it for line-by-line checking. Download PDBbind v2020 ([pdbbind.org.cn](http://www.pdbbind.org.cn))
and PPIKB / the PPI-Affinity SI first (the large/external inputs are gitignored; the small IFP caches ship
in `data/`). Run each with `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` on this machine for the speed the docs assume.

Rebuild the IFP training cache from raw structures (the 437 new PPIKB complexes) with
`python scripts/e303_build_ppikb_ifp.py`. The full experiment ledger (E0–E304, every win and every refuted
idea) is in [`docs/DEVELOPMENT_TIMELINE.md`](docs/DEVELOPMENT_TIMELINE.md).
